## My Exploration of Pytorch

### [1. CNN](fruits-360) - [Fruits 360 Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits)
This is my first model that I am uploading to Github and was my second attempt on creating a model to classify 131 classes of fruit.  The model is built with Pytorch and may not be the best code there is.

I implemented early stopping through a class built with [`pytorchtools`](https://pypi.org/project/pytorchtools/).  The module was not able to be imported so I copied and pasted the early stopping class.

I made a graph of the model's confidence of predictions as well as plotting the ROC curve.
